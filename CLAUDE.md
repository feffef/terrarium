# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code agents working in this repo. Terrarium is developed
**mostly by agents** — you are a first-class contributor here, not a bystander.
This file is the entry point for every session: it holds the conventions, the
repo layout, and how to self-verify. `README.md` is only a primer for humans.

## Read these first

- **`CONTEXT.md`** — the domain model and ubiquitous language. Use these exact
  terms (Platform, Tenant, Space, Collection, Document, Skill, …). If you catch
  yourself using a word that conflicts with the glossary, stop and reconcile it.
- **`docs/adr/`** — Architecture Decision Records. **Read *all* of them before
  any planning or structural work.** The set is deliberately kept small, and each
  records a decision that is easy to violate by accident. Don't rely on a
  hand-maintained list of ADRs anywhere (it rots) — read the directory.
- **Skills** live in `.agents/skills/` (surfaced through `.claude/skills/`
  symlinks). The **`domain-modeling`** skill owns the conventions for the two
  files above: `CONTEXT.md` stays **glossary-only** (no implementation detail),
  and it defines the 3-part test for *when* a decision earns an ADR — **hard to
  reverse · surprising without context · a real trade-off**. Note: every ADR in
  this repo uses the fuller `Context / Decision / Consequences` form — match it
  for consistency rather than the skill's minimal template. It also owns the
  **rule of two** for new vocabulary (coin a glossary/ADR term only on a
  concept's *second* instance) — see `docs/agents/domain.md`.
- **Which Skills to actually use** is curated in the `journal` Tenant's **Skill
  Inventory** — `tenants/journal/content/current/skills/`, rendered at
  `/t/journal/current`. It records each installed Skill's *role and importance to
  this project* (not a copy of the Skill's own description), because the Skills
  come from an external pack. Treat it as the authoritative "use these" list:
  take these Skills seriously and prefer them over ad-hoc approaches, guided by
  each entry's `importance` and `role`.

## Ground rules (from the ADRs)

- One repo, one container, build-time-baked; nothing is created at runtime
  (ADR-0001).
- Agents edit a Tenant's **manifest** (declarative intent); `content.config.ts`
  builds the keyed collections dynamically from the manifests at
  config-evaluation time (ADR-0002/0013). Don't hand-write the keyed cross-product.
- Every change lands as a **gated PR** on a feature branch — no self-merge.
  Autonomy may *propose* freely but *implements* net-new only on human
  green-light (ADR-0003).
- All work must clear the **safety gate** (build/validate/isolation, ADR-0004).
  The routing module, isolation logic, and CI are **human-only** — never
  auto-merge changes touching them.
- **Skills** are generic, repo-committed, and first-class (ADR-0005).
- Runtime routing is by path prefix `/t/<tenant>/<space>/<slug>` (ADR-0006). The
  routing map is derived at build time from the manifests via `modules/routing.ts`
  and exposed as the `#routing` virtual module (ADR-0014) — no committed `GENERATED`
  file remains. `content.config.ts` is NOT generated: it is an ordinary,
  hand-editable module (ADR-0013).
- **Only the `pages` Collection is route-addressable.** The resolver maps a
  slug to a Space's `pages` key only; every other Collection (`sessions`,
  `skills`, digests, …) is surfaced by layer components, not its own slug
  route (ADR-0006). A new page-like addressable Collection is therefore not
  free — it means changing the human-only resolver/routing (ADR-0004/0006).

## Working conventions

- **An empty or missing task prompt (body lost in transit, only a title
  present) is a hard stop-and-ask signal.** Ask the user what they want —
  don't infer a feature from the branch name, prior commits, or a matching
  repo pattern.
- **Single-home every fact — one home, everywhere else points, never restates.**
  Each fact lives in exactly one place; every other surface *references* it. This
  file is the home for repo-wide conventions and an **index** into the ADRs — so
  where it would restate ADR detail, link the ADR instead of copying it (the
  "Ground rules" index-with-pointers below is the right shape; a restated *status
  narrative* is not). `CONTEXT.md` stays **glossary-only**; the ADRs are the
  historical record. When a fact and reality diverge, fix the one home (an
  amending note or superseding ADR), don't fork a second copy. Duplication is how
  contradictory guidance and doc-rot start — and agents act on documented state,
  so in this repo a stale copy is a *behavioral* bug.
- Inspect files with the **Read tool, not `cat`** — the Edit tool refuses to edit
  a file it hasn't seen via Read, so `cat`-then-Edit forces a wasteful re-read.
- **Run process-killing teardown as its own command, never `&&`-chained** before
  steps that must run. Two failure modes, both observed here: `pkill` exits 1
  when nothing matched (routine in idempotent teardown), and `pkill -f` can
  match the invoking shell's own command line and kill the whole chain
  mid-flight — either way everything after the `&&` is silently dropped,
  e.g. a chained `git add` never runs and no error points at it.
- **Don't `&&`-chain a branch rename/creation with the commit/push steps that
  follow it** — the same silent-drop failure mode as the pkill bullet above:
  `git branch -m ... && git commit ... && git push` (or `checkout -b`) fails at
  the rename/create when the branch already exists locally, and every step
  after the `&&` never runs. Check existence first (e.g. `git rev-parse
  --verify <branch>`) and handle the already-exists case explicitly instead of
  chaining blindly.
- **Keep session-log-only commits content-only.** Never let substantive work
  ride along inside a commit titled as a session-log commit — title the commit
  for the work it actually contains instead.
- **Commit messages containing backticks or `$(...)` must be written with
  `git commit -F <file>`** (or a quoted heredoc), never `git commit -m` —
  inside a double-quoted `-m` argument the shell runs the backtick/`$()` span
  as a command and mangles the commit body.
- **For any since-last-merge diff or review, run `git fetch origin main` first
  and anchor on the merge-base** (`git merge-base origin/main HEAD`) or the
  commit under review (`HEAD~1`) — the environment's pre-cloned `origin/main`
  is often stale and inflates the diff to 100+ unrelated files.
- **Keep a PR's description in sync with its content — hard rule.** If you
  fundamentally change what a PR does (switch approach, swap the files it touches,
  answer review with a different solution), update the PR title/description in the
  same push. A description that still sells the old approach is a defect, not a
  nit: reviewers gate on it.
- **Pushing is not landing.** A PR is finished only when it is **merged** or
  **abandoned/escalated** — not at push time; review, CI, and merge are all still
  queued. Babysit the PR you opened through to that terminal state. (This is a
  PR-completion discipline, distinct from *session logging*, which now fires at
  self-judged closure and records an in-review PR honestly — see "Logging your
  session".)
- **Three distinct worktree-isolation mechanisms exist in this environment — pick
  the one that matches the task, don't conflate them:**
  1. **`EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree`** (interactive, session-level) — switches
     *this whole session's* working directory into a new git worktree. Use it
     only when the user explicitly says "worktree", or CLAUDE.md/memory directs
     the current task to run in one — never invoke it proactively for routine
     work.
  2. **The Agent tool's `isolation: 'worktree'` parameter** (per-subagent) — the
     mechanism for dispatched subagents, especially parallel ones, that will
     touch git. Pass it **explicitly** — it is an Agent-tool parameter, not
     implied by the prompt. Without it, "parallel" agents share one checkout and
     race on branches.
  3. **Plain manual `git worktree add`** — an ordinary git operation with no
     session-switching or Agent-tool wiring. Use it only for an ad-hoc, one-off
     worktree you'll manage by hand yourself (e.g. inspecting another branch's
     tree side by side) — it is not a substitute for either tool above, and a
     subagent brief that says "use `git worktree add`" instead of passing
     `isolation: 'worktree'` is doing mechanism 2's job with the wrong mechanism.
  - **For mechanism 2, "pin its worktree root" is not enough on its own — the
    sharp edge is that a dispatched subagent's Bash tool does not preserve
    working directory across separate tool calls.** A single `cd` into the
    worktree root early in a subagent's work does **not** carry over to a later,
    separate Bash invocation — each call starts from whatever cwd the harness
    resets to. So when briefing a worktree-isolated subagent, **every
    git-touching command in the brief must itself include the
    `cd <worktree-root> &&` step** — never phrase the brief as "cd into your
    worktree, then run these git commands," since that reads as a one-time
    setup step the subagent will (correctly, given how the tool actually
    behaves) fail to repeat.

```

## Self-verification — the safety gate (ADR-0004)

Run this before proposing any change. CI (`.github/workflows/gate.yml`) runs the same set,
cheapest-first. Both the keyed collections and the routing map (`#routing`) are derived
from the manifests at build time (ADR-0013/0014) — no regenerate step needed.

```
pnpm install     # installs deps, then runs `nuxt prepare` (derives #routing + collections)
pnpm lint        # L0
pnpm typecheck   # L0
pnpm test        # L3 — isolation unit tests (unique, scoped keys)
pnpm build       # L0/L1 — build; strict schemas fail the build on invalid content
pnpm test:e2e    # L2 — smoke-render every (Tenant, Space) entry route (200, renders)
```

**Need a screenshot of a running page** (e.g. to eyeball a render during a session)?
Run `pnpm exec tsx scripts/screenshot.ts <url> <out.png> [WxH]` — it drives the
pre-installed Chromium directly (via `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`), no new
dependency or browser download required. The optional `WxH` (e.g. `1280x1600`)
sets the window size — use it to reach below-the-fold content. Use `pnpm dev`
for fast visual iteration when you only need to eyeball a render. For a
production-accurate shot use a built `pnpm preview` instead — the dev server
injects a Nuxt DevTools overlay badge (e.g. a small "26 ms" timing pill) that
can overlap real content and read as a UI bug.

### Verifying UI changes

- **Grepping SSR HTML is not proof a change renders.** The server-rendered
  output includes a serialized `useAsyncData` payload — a string match there can
  succeed even when the actual DOM never picks up the change (or errors trying
  to). Verify presentational changes against the **rendered DOM**, not the raw
  HTML text — take a screenshot with `scripts/screenshot.ts` (see above), or
  drive the page with Playwright.
- **To verify a click/interaction, not just a static render**, write a small
  ad-hoc `playwright-core` script against the same pre-installed Chromium
  `scripts/screenshot.ts` locates (via `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`) — launch it
  with `chromium.launch({ executablePath })`. Two gotchas: (1) `tsx` runs the
  ad-hoc script as CJS, so wrap top-level `await` in an `async` IIFE; (2) write
  the script **inside the repo tree** so its imports resolve against
  `node_modules` (any devDependency used in an ad-hoc script — `playwright-core`,
  `yaml`, etc. — is scoped to this repo's `node_modules`, not global).
- **A screenshot can't be trusted to rule out a subtle/scoped CSS change** —
  downscaled or compressed PNGs can mask a style that actually applied. Before
  concluding a scoped style is missing, probe the element's *computed* style
  with the same `playwright-core` pattern above, e.g.
  `page.$eval(selector, el => getComputedStyle(el).propertyName)`. A
  screenshot confirms a render happened; computed-style probing confirms a
  *specific* style took effect.
- **The journal Space landing is a custom dashboard, not a Markdown render.**
  `tenants/journal/app/pages/t/journal/[space]/index.vue` wins over the generic
  catch-all for the Space *root* and builds its own layout (stat tiles, digests,
  session feed, Skill Inventory, …) from the Space's `pages`/`skills`/`sessions`
  Collections. It renders `index.md`'s body only as the small "editorial intro"
  section — most of the page is not `index.md`. Editing `index.md` alone will
  not change what most of that page shows; check the `.vue` file too.

To **add a Space or Collection**: edit the Tenant's `tenant.config.ts`. The keyed
collections update automatically via `content.config.ts`, and the routing map
(`#routing`) is re-derived at the next `nuxt prepare`/`build`. No regenerate step
needed. To **spawn a Tenant**: drop a `tenants/<name>/` folder with a manifest and
content, then run `pnpm install` (or `nuxt prepare`) to pick it up.

## Logging your session

Every session ends with an honest **session log** in the Journal (ADR-0009,
issue #2) — the raw signal the future `consolidate`/`codify` jobs mine. A log
has two halves (ADR-0009 amendment): the **mechanical** trace (timings, models,
tools, files read/edited, subagents) is **derived from the transcript** by a
committed hook — never self-reported; the **interpretive** half (goal, outcome,
summary, and *every* friction) only you can write. The **`log-session`** Skill
authors the interpretive half to a scratch file; a committed hook derives the
rest and commits to `main` **live, normally well before session teardown** —
see the `log-session` Skill for which hook lands it and why.

**You self-judge closure — invoke `log-session` when the session's active work
is complete and coherent.** No "are we done?" ask, no waiting for merge: closure
means the work is in an honest, coherent state (a log records an in-review PR
truthfully). Authoring the scratch *is* the "done" signal — the hook commits
**only if** it exists, so a mid-work freeze logs nothing. Re-invoking is safe:
it refreshes the scratch, and the hook overwrites the single per-session log
with a superset (diff-guarded — an unchanged re-derive never touches `main`). So
if you call closure and then do more, just invoke `log-session` again.

Because authoring no longer commits and re-firing self-heals, `log-session` is
**model-invocable** — invoke it yourself at closure rather than on a human
prompt. This mechanism serves autonomous sessions too: they write the scratch
before ending, on purpose.

## Status

Current-state facts — which Tenants, Spaces, and Collections exist, and what's
still deferred (more Tenants, the platform-operation Skills, the autonomous jobs)
— are single-homed elsewhere, not restated here where they rot: the **ADRs**
record what is *decided vs. deliberately left open*, and the `journal` Tenant
(`/t/journal/current`) narrates where the build actually is. Read those before
building rather than a milestone summary duplicated in this file.

## Agent skills

Per-repo configuration for Matt Pocock's engineering skills lives in `docs/agents/`.

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs are tracked as GitHub issues in `feffef/terrarium` (via the `gh` CLI, or the GitHub MCP tools when `gh` is absent); external PRs are also pulled into the triage queue. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical label vocabulary — `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Tenant-layer conventions

Nuxt-layer gotchas for editing a Tenant (alias resolution, layer-local imports, CSS token inheritance). See `docs/agents/tenant-layers.md`.
