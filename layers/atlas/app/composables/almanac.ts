// The Almanac — the shared reactive state under the specimen page's almanac
// dial (#282, map #279), and THE contract the dial-driven MDC components
// (`::almanac`, `:season`, `::season-note`, `::sighting`) build against. The
// dial is the essay's season selector: the shared `day` decides which season
// the needle rides, and each `::season-note` shows only in its own season, so
// turning the dial swaps the prose. Auto-imported layer-wide
// (docs/agents/tenant-layers.md §1).
//
// ── The contract ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The specimen page owns the state and provides it once in its setup:
//
//   const almanac = provideAlmanac({
//     phases: () => specimen.value?.phenology?.phases ?? [], // live getter
//     initialDay: parseAlmanacDayParam(route.query.day),     // null → today
//   })
//
// Any descendant — the wheel itself, or an MDC component arbitrarily deep
// inside `<ContentRenderer>` — injects it:
//
//   const almanac = useAlmanac()   // Almanac | null
//
// `useAlmanac()` returns **null** (never throws) when no ancestor provided the
// state, so an MDC component pasted into a non-specimen Document degrades
// gracefully instead of crashing the page — always null-check.
//
// Typical usage: a `::season-note{of="x"}` shows while `seasonOf(day.value)` is
// its season (collapsing to the needle's season on mount — see SeasonNote); a
// `::sighting{date}` does `register({ id: useId(), day: dateToDay(date),
// kind: 'sighting' })` in setup and `unregister(id)` in `onUnmounted`. Marks
// registered by components that render after the wheel (everything inside the
// essay does) appear on the dial reactively — client-side, post-hydration — by
// design, so the server-rendered markup stays mismatch-free.
//
// ── Extensions ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `focusPulse`/`focusDay(day)` — the clickable-tick path: tapping a dial tick
// moves the needle to that exact day AND bumps `focusPulse`, and the matching
// `::sighting` watches the pulse to scroll its quote into view. Distinct from
// the silent `setDay` so a descendant reacts only to a deliberate "take me
// there", not to every drag that crosses its day.
// `observations`/`findSighting(date)` — the biome's dated ledger, provided by
// the page alongside `phases`, so a `::sighting{date}` can quote the
// observation's own note without retyping it (single-homed; lookup semantics
// in utils/almanacState.ts's findObservationOn).
//
// ── SSR / hydration (#279 decision 4) ────────────────────────────────────────
// `today` is computed once per request on the server and carried to the client
// in the Nuxt payload (`useState`), so a request served across midnight — or a
// server in another timezone — cannot park the SSR needle on one day and the
// hydrating client's on another. The state itself is created in the page's
// setup, i.e. per request: nothing leaks across requests. The mark-list and
// parsing semantics are pure functions in `utils/almanacState.ts`, unit-tested
// in `layers/atlas/tests/unit/almanac-state.spec.ts`.
