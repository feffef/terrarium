// Shared data-load prologue for the Atlas layer's two Space-scoped pages — the
// biome landing (`[space]/index.vue`) and the specimen entry (`[space]/[...slug].vue`,
// #66/#67). Both pages need the SAME three keyed reads (this biome's `pages`,
// `interactions`, `observations`) and the same specimen-by-slug lookup that the
// food web, relations list, and field log all read for counterpart names — that
// was repeated verbatim in both pages (code review). Single-homed here instead.
// Named with Atlas vocabulary ("wing" = a biome landing's whole data need), not a
// generic name — the auto-import namespace is global across every layer
// (tenant-layers.md §1).
//
// Isolation-respecting (ADR-0004): this takes the ALREADY-resolved
// `useSpace('atlas')` context as input rather than re-resolving the route
// itself — the isolation-critical resolution step stays exactly where it was
// (`useSpace` → `resolveSpaceRoute`); this composable only shapes the
// same-Space data those keys already scope, so no isolation logic moves or
// duplicates. The caller still passes its own `useAsyncData` key (each page
// used `route.path` before extraction) so payload/dedup behaviour — one cache
// entry per route, not a merged one — is unchanged.
